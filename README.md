# AddonScraps
A collection of any plugins or themes I've made for BetterDiscord which won't be published and/or are abandoned.

**No guarantee any of these work!**


# ATTTest
- Early, even more unstable version of a plugin I'm still working on :P I think wing dings gaster cursed it tbh

# CustomWordmark
-  Added a Discord wordmark back to the title bar like how it was pre-visual refresh with the option to choose between the modern and classic wordmarks

# LancerButton 
- Joke plugin made for a friend. Lancers you. Will probably spam the console with errors

# NoteTest
- Early POC which evolved into NewOldPopouts (unpublished as of now), still pretty useful

# PresenceTest_Legacy 
- Old version of HeaderPresence (discontinued), bad code ahead

# ProfileRestructure
- Pre-rewrite version of NewOldProfiles

# ReDiscrim
- Added someone's user discriminator (#0000) back to their profile if it was available due to the user displaying the legacy name badge

# RestoreUserPanelButtons
- Plugin made for 11pixels even though he can't even use it because he uses vencord, bleh

# ThePopoutToEndAllPopouts
- Pre-rewrite version of NewOldPopouts (unpublished as of now)

# cookie
- idk. will probably break your client

# modalTest
- doesn't work. will freeze your client upon opening a profile modal
